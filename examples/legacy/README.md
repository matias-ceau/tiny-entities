# Legacy Examples

The `legacy/` folder archives earlier prototypes that informed Tiny Entities. The original
`little_social_dreamers` mini-application now lives here to keep the main package focused on the
current simulation stack.

You can still run it with:

```bash
uv run python examples/legacy/little_social_dreamers/main.py
```

Keep in mind that it does not benefit from the latest LLM integration or sound synthesis features.
