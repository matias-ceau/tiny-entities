# Improved configuration for better visualization and interactions
# Addresses: less food, more mood variation, better interactions

world:
  width: 100
  height: 100
  food_spawn_rate: 0.04          # REDUCED from 0.1 - less food means more scarcity and movement
  food_respawn_probability: 0.008  # Slower respawn
  food_respawn_amount: 0.003      # Smaller respawn amounts
  obstacle_density: 0.03          # REDUCED from 0.05 - obstacles will be patterned, not random
  sound_decay_rate: 0.85          # SLOWER decay - sounds linger longer for better detection

creatures:
  initial_count: 12               # MORE creatures for more interactions
  starting_health: 120.0          # Slightly more health for longer survival
  starting_energy: 120.0
  perception_radius: 6            # LARGER radius - see more, interact more
  max_action_tokens: 60
  initial_action_tokens: 15       # More tokens to start
  energy_cost_per_step: 0.8       # LOWER cost - creatures live longer
  health_decay_when_no_energy: 0.15

mood:
  fast_learning_rate: 0.25        # MUCH FASTER arousal changes (was 0.1)
  slow_learning_rate: 0.05        # FASTER valence changes (was 0.01)
  arousal_decay: 0.95             # FASTER decay (was 0.99) - more dynamic moods
  initial_valence: 0.0            # Start neutral
  initial_arousal: 0.6            # Start somewhat activated

actions:
  acceptance_rate: 0.9
  llm_action_probability: 0.3     # MORE LLM actions for more interesting behavior

rewards:
  surprise_multiplier: 0.7        # HIGHER surprise impact on mood
  food_reward: 1.5                # BIGGER reward for food (since it's scarcer)
  social_sound_reward: 0.5        # BIGGER reward for social sounds - encourage communication
  collision_penalty: -0.3         # BIGGER penalty - encourage avoidance
  proximity_reward: 0.2           # BIGGER reward - encourage clustering

analysis:
  analyze_every: 300              # MORE FREQUENT analysis (was 500)
