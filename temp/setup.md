I'll help you create a complete project structure for your tiny entities repo. Let me generate all the necessary files:Now let me create the remaining key files to complete the project:Now let me provide instructions for setting up your GitHub repository and configuring Claude Code:Perfect! I've created a complete project structure for your tiny entities simulation with the emergent mood system. Here's how to get everything set up:

## Quick Setup Steps:

1. **Create all files locally**:
   - Copy each file content from the artifacts above
   - Save them in the correct directory structure
   - Make sure to maintain the exact folder hierarchy

2. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add emergent mood system and complete project structure"
git push origin main
```

3. **Set up environment**:
```bash
# Clone and enter repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiny-entities.git
cd tiny-entities

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env from example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

4. **Test the simulation**:
```bash
# Basic run
python -m src.simulation.main_loop

# With visualization
python examples/basic_simulation.py --visualize
```

## Key Features Implemented:

1. **Emergent Mood System**:
   - Mood emerges from reward prediction errors
   - No hardcoded "food = good" rules
   - Creatures learn their own associations

2. **Balanced Design**:
   - Simple physics (rigid structure)
   - Emergent behaviors (flexible outcomes)
   - Observable patterns (visual/audio)

3. **Cost-Effective API Usage**:
   - Free models for creature actions
   - Premium models only for weekly analysis
   - Daily cost limit of â‚¬2

4. **Claude Code Integration**:
   - Auto-reload on file changes
   - Easy command shortcuts
   - Proper Python environment handling

The mood system now works exactly as you wanted - creatures develop their own "self-narrative" based on what actually gets them rewards (surprise, food when hungry, successful social interactions). Their mood influences their behavior tendencies, but doesn't determine them rigidly.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or help you customize any parameters?
